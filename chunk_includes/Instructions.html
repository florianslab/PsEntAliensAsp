    <p> This experiment is a simple guessing game: you will have to determine which of two pictures corresponds to a sentence description.
      The next screens will guide you through the task, but before we start with the instructions, please fill out this form for us.
      </p>
    
    <p> Thank you. </p>
<!-- <p>
In this experiment, you will see a series of pictures of seven aliens. These aliens have a special ability: they may change color.
  Unlike humans, they are not able to directly perceive their own skin color. They can only learn about their own skin color by using
  a special machine that functions like a mirror for the aliens. Unfortunately, in the manufacturing process of some of these machines,
  something went wrong, so that some machines have a defect and output the wrong color.
</p>
<p>
Because of this defect, the aliens in this experiment are not always aware of the color that they have at that moment. This means that
  it sometimes happens that an alien has a different color than what he thinks he has. In a thought bubble, you will see what color each
  alien thinks he has. In addition, you, but not the aliens themselves, will be able to see their actual color.
</p>
<p>
An example of four aliens is given in the picture below. Here, the alien on the left thinks he is colored pink, while actually he is colored yellow.
  The aliens in the middle both also think that they are colored pink, while actually both of them are colored red. Finally, the alien on the right
  thinks it is colored red, and indeed he is colored red.
</p>

<p>
In every trial you will read a one sentence description, and you will see two images with 7 aliens each. You will
  have to choose the picture that matches the sentence. However, an additional complication
  of this guessing game is that one of the pictures is hidden from your view. Because there always is just one picture that matches
  the displayed sentence, you should only choose the hidden picture if the visible picture does not
  match the sentence.
</p>
<p>
  An example of what a trial looks like is given below. In one picture the aliens are hidden, in the other they are visible:

 <p>
  You should press the F key on your keyboard if you think the sentence describes the picture at the left of the screen;
   press the J key on your keyboard if you think the sentence describes the picture at the right of the screen.
   If possible, please press the F key with your left index and press the J key with your right index. Please
   try to press a key as soon as you decided which picture matches the sentence.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   We will start with some practice trials, and after that we will proceed to the actual experiment. First read the sentence that describes the aliens,
    then press any key to continue, and pick one of the two images by using the F and J keys on your keyboard.
